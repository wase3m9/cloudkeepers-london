<ol>
<li><strong>Wrong VAT Calculations</strong>: Errors in applying VAT rates or currency conversions can lead to penalties. Use accounting software to automate calculations and reduce errors.</li>
<li><strong>Missed Filing Deadlines</strong>: Late submissions can result in fines starting at £200. Set reminders or use digital tools to stay on schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Expense Categories</strong>: Misclassifying expenses like business meals or travel can distort VAT claims. Review <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs" target="_blank">HMRC</a> guidelines and use software to organize expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Poor Record Keeping</strong>: Failing to keep essential documents (sales invoices, receipts, bank statements) for 6 years can lead to compliance issues. Digital tools make storage and retrieval easier.</li>
<li><strong>Missing VAT Rule Updates</strong>: Changes like <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital" target="_blank">Making Tax Digital</a> (MTD) require businesses to use approved platforms. Stay informed through HMRC updates or professional accountants.</li>
